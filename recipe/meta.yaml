  summary: Computational materials design, with less code
  description: |
    relentless is a Python package for executing molecular simulations in larger
    computational workflows. The simulation protocol is specified as a
    reproducible, human-readable recipe that is run natively in popular engines
    such as LAMMPS and HOOMD-blue. relentless also has robust features for
    optimization with simulations, including independent and dependent variables
    with automatic differentiation, objective functions of simulations, and
    optimization methods.  All features are readily extensible through a clean
    hierarchy of abstract objects, enabling you to quickly use your own
    simulation code or optimization objective.
